            Reading is one of my favorite pass time activities. During my free
            time today, I was happy to read and analyze complex scientific
            material. This short activity required coordination between
            different parts of my brain. Below is an analysis of the different
            parts that collectively made this activity a success; • The
            prefrontal cortex made it possible for me to organize the
            information as I read it. This part of the brain is responsible for
            planning, and decision making during the reading process. • The
            occipital lobe is necessary in the visualization of information.
            Reading is an activity that needs one to tap into their imagination
            so they can understand the writer's point of view. It is also
            involved in the visualization of words. • Reading is an unsuccessful
            activity if one does remember the content much later. The
            hippocampus is the part responsible for forming memories. This
            ensures that I could have a memory of the information I had gotten
            from the activity. • The cerebellum allowed smooth transitions
            between activities conducted during the reading process. For
            instance, it controlled how I took up the information, processed it,
            and eventually summarized it for my understanding. As a
            neuroscientist, I would love to know more about the hippocampus. I
            would specifically use complex imaging techniques such as MRI, which
            would allow me to observe it's activity. A functional MRI would give
            more conclusive results, as it would pick up details such as blood
            flow, and the overall hippocampal activity.
